# SNN-NN

Environment

      Our SNN-NN architecture is only implemented in PyTorch 1.4.0 (or higher). 



Content (Folders):

      1. Data: please put CIFAR10 dataset here;

      2. Src: includes 'testing.py', 'model.py', 'layer.py', 'utils.py';
	'testing.py' is executable.
	'model.py' and 'layer.py' build up our SNN-NN architecture.
	'utils.py' can display the running results on the screen.

      3. Results: saves the results of the test;

      4. Checkpoint: includes includes optimal AN (SNN) params and NN params. Please unzip NN_Params.zip



Run

      We directly run test.py in the Src file, as follows:

            python test.py
